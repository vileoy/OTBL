# OTBL
OTBL (Oriented Trigonal Bipyramid Links) is a delicate program designed by Haoyu Lin, which is used to identify all possible topological structures of strands-based DNA trigonal bipyramids.

## 1 Usage

Note that Python 3 is a prerequisite for running this program. If you have correctly installed Python 3, please implement the following commands to launch it.

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/vileoy/OTBL.git
$ cd src
$ python otbl.py
```

After exectution, an output file `links.txt` will be created, which contains all desired structures. And  subsequently, you can use the script in `misc` directory to transform the result into latex format.
